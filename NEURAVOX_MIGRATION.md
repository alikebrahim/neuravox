# Neuravox Migration Summary

## Project Renaming

The project has been successfully renamed from "Audio Workflow Platform" to **Neuravox** (Neural Vox).

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- Renamed `audio-workflow-platform/` → `neuravox/`

### 2. Package Configuration
- Updated `pyproject.toml`:
  - Package name: `neuravox`
  - Description: "Neuravox - Neural audio processing and transcription platform"
  - CLI entry point: `neuravox = "cli.main:app"`
  - Updated dependency: `google-genai = ">=0.8.0"` (replaced deprecated google-generativeai)

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Default workspace path: `~/neuravox/`
- Environment variable prefixes:
  - `AUDIO_WORKFLOW_*` → `NEURAVOX_*`
  - `AUDIO_PROCESSING_*` → `NEURAVOX_PROCESSING_*`
  - `TRANSCRIPTION_*` → `NEURAVOX_TRANSCRIPTION_*`
- Config file path: `~/.config/neuravox/config.yaml`

### 4. Code Updates
- Exception class: `AudioWorkflowError` → `NeuravoxError`
- CLI app name: `audio-workflow` → `neuravox`
- All internal references updated

### 5. Documentation Updates

## Command Changes

All commands have been updated:

```bash
# Old commands
audio-workflow init
audio-workflow process --interactive
audio-workflow status
audio-workflow resume
audio-workflow config

# New commands
neuravox init
neuravox process --interactive
neuravox status
neuravox resume
neuravox config
```

## Installation

```bash
cd neuravox
uv pip install -e .
```

## Legacy Module Support

The original modules (`audio_processor` and `ai_transcriber`) remain functional for backward compatibility, with their READMEs pointing to the main Neuravox documentation.

## Next Steps

1. Update any external references (GitHub repo name, documentation links)
2. Update CI/CD pipelines if any
3. Consider creating a logo for Neuravox
4. Update any deployment scripts

The project is now fully branded as **Neuravox** - a neural audio processing and transcription platform.
